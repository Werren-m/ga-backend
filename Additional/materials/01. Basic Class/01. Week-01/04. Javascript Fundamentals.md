# Overview
In this material you will learn what you need to know in Javascript. Like what is Variable and how to use it etc. As I said before, Javascript is a programming language, and we as a Backend Engineer will run this languange inside our machine directly. That was why we need node.js

* You know the primitive data types 

# What is Javascript?
Javascript is a programming languange that will allow you to implement some logic inside that. That means we can create a variable, function, etc.

## Let's talk about Javascript Syntax
Syntax is a set of rule when we write something in a programming languange, it is like Grammar is our daily languange.

In a language we can create a statement to tell people what you want to tell, it can be instruction, or just an information.

Programming Languange can also create a statement, to tell the computer what you want it to do, or just give them an information that you will use later.

### How to create a statement?

It's simple, you might already create a simple statement in the Git Introduction materials.
```javascript
console.log("Hello World)
```
This guy is a statement, that will tell your computer to print out "Hello World" string in the terminal.

But, statement isn't just about `console.log`, there's a ton of statement that you can create. It can be declaration, etc.
Here's an example of how you will write two statement or more:
```js
console.log("First statement"); console.log("Another statement");

// Or it can be writen like this
console.log("First statement")
console.log("Another statement")
```

I'll give you one more example about statement, but this time, we only tell our computer an information.
```js
let a = 10;
```
In above statement, we tell our computer that we have a variable named `a`, and it contains `10` as its value. So, what is variable then?

### What is Comment?
Comment is a text inside our code that the compiler or interpreter will ignore that text. This is useful since we can pass any information in our code directly using comment.
* One-Line Comment
  ```js
  // Here's how we create a statement

  console.log("Hello World") // This code will print out Hello World
  ```
* Multi-Line Comment
  ```js
  /* With this type of comment,
     we can write multiline comment inside here
     It will be really useful if you have
     a long explaination about you code */

  console.log("Hello World");
  ```

## What is Variable?
Variable is basically a name of something. Let's say we have table, it has four leg and one big plank attach to it and it is made from Wood. If there's no variable we will call that object like this
```
Hey, Four Legged wood with one big plank in it!
```

With variable we can just call that object as `Table` rather than calling it like that.

And, variable is also a place where we can store data. We will talk about this later.

### Let's create a variable
To do this, you need to create a file with .js extention in it.

I assume that you've already create a file with .js extention, now let's code!
```javascript
let a = 10;
```
Good, now you have variable called a, you can call a whenever you like inside your code. Let's say I want to use a in aritmathic operation.
```js
console.log(a + 5);
// Output: 15
```
When you write `let a = 10`, we declare that there's a variable called a, and it has value 10. So it is called `variable declaration`.

There's three way to declare a variable in Javascript.
* Using `let`
  ```js
  let a = 10;

  // Or 
  let b;
  b = 10; // This was called assignment
  ```
* Using `var`
  ```js
  var a = 10;

  // Or
  var a; // This was called redeclaration
  a = 10; // This was called assignment as well
  ```
* Using `const`
  ```js
  const a = 10;
  // There's no other way to create a constant variable but this.
  ```

### Let, Var, and Const
There's a significant difference when you `let`, `const` or `var`. They have their own behaviour in code. I'll classify this into two category.
1. Mutable Variable (`var`, `let`)
2. Immutable Variable (`const`)

#### Mutable Variable
Mutable variable is basically a variable that its value can changes in any code. Let's say I have box a (`let a`) that contains 10 pieces of apple. I can change that box to contains manggo etc, as much as I want.
```js
let a; // Create a variable called a
a = 10; // Assign a with 10
a = 20; // Reassign a with 20

var b; // Create a variable called b
b = 10; // Assign b with 10
b = 20; // Reassign b with 20

var b = 50; // Redeclare b and assign it with 50
```

The difference between `let` and `var` is let won't allow you redeclare the variable, but it will only allow you to reassign the value.
```js
let a = 10;
let a = 20;

/* 
Thrown:
SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared */
```

#### Immutable Variable
Immutable variable is a variable that has a constant value, it means you can't reassign new valu on it or even redeclare the variable.
```js
const z = 10; // Declare a variable called z

z = 20;

/* 
Thrown:
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. */
```

This type of variable usually being used to store a value that is constant, i.e `colors`, `module`, etc.

## Number and it's operation
You already create a few of variable, and I believe most of them contains number. So what is number actually in Javascript.
Basically it's just a number like in Math. But, there's three type of number in Javascript.
* Int
* Bigint
* Float
* Double

But don't worry, in Javascript they're simply classfied as number.
Let's do the operation then!
```js
console.log(10 + 20); // Addition
30

console.log(10 - 20); // Substraction
-10

console.log(4 * 2); // Multiplication
8

console.log(4 / 2); // Division
2

console.log(4 ** 2); // Exponential
16
```

You can change that number with variable that has number as its value.

## Function
Just like in mathematic, we use function to run a defined operation. But, in Javascript it can be procedure and bunch of statement inside it!

### Function with no argument
```js
// Declare a function
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}

// Call that function
hello();
"Hello World!"
```

This function is not having an arguments. That means we don't need to pass any args when we run it. Just as simple as `hello()`

### Function with argument
This is relateable for your mathematical knowledge. In math, the way we declare a function is by writing this:
```
f(x) = x + 1
```
And if we want to run it, we can just simply write this:
```
f(2) = 2 + 1
f(2) = 3
```
It's the same when you're working with function in Javascript.
Let's create that `f(x)` function by using Javascript:
```js
function f(x) {
  return x + 1;
}

console.log(f(2)); // 3
```

### Run a procedure inside function
Let's say you want to create a function that will do complex calculation you can do that.
```js
function calculateTubeVolume(r, t) {
  var circleArea = 3.14 * (r**2);
  return circleArea * t;
}

console.log(
  calculateTubeVolume(5, 3)
) // 235.5
```
