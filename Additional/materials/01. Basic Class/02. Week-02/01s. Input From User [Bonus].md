* You know how to validate an input from user

# How to ask for an input via terminal

To do this thing, we need to call Node.js built in module called readline. How to use this?

```js
// Require function will allow you to call the module
const readline = require('readline');

// Initiate the readline to use stdin and stdout as input and output
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

rl.question('What do you think of Node.js? ', (answer) => {
  console.log(`Thank you for your valuable feedback: ${answer}`);

  rl.close();
});
```

## Implement it in your project

Your project in the last week, probably just like this.

```js
function calcRectangleArea(width, length) {
  return width * length;
}
```

Now, you don't want to insert the width and length manually in your code, you want the user to decide the width and the length. All we need to do is just call the readline module and start asking question.

```js
// Require function will allow you to call the module
const readline = require('readline');

// Initiate the readline to use stdin and stdout as input and output
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

// Start up message
console.clear(); // To clear up the terminal
console.log("I can calculate the rectangle area for you");

// The function
function calcRectangleArea(width, length) {
  return width * length;
}

// Ask the width
rl.question('Width: ', (width) => {
  
  // Ask the length
  rl.question('Length: ', (length) => {
    console.log(
      "Here's the result:",
      calcRectangleArea(width, length)
    )
    
    rl.close();
  })
});
```

## Since you might having more than one function

In order to make your CLI (Command Line Interface) works, you need to declare a procedure when you're running that terminal. Let's say, the first time the user open up the apps, it will ask the user, which calculation they want to do. And you code will be like this.

```js
// Require function will allow you to call the module
const readline = require('readline');

// Initiate the readline to use stdin and stdout as input and output
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

// Start up message
console.clear(); // To clear up the terminal
console.log("Which one do you want to calculate?");
console.log(`
1. Rectangle Area
2. Triangle Area
`)

// The function
function calcRectangleArea(width, length) {
  return width * length;
}

function calcTriangleArea(base, height) {
  return base * height / 2
}

// Procedure
function handleAnswer1() {
  console.clear();
  console.log("Calculate Rectangle Area");

  // Ask for the width
  rl.question("Width: ", width => {
    
    // Ask for the length
    rl.question("Length: ", length => {
       console.log(
         "Here's the result:",
         calcRectangleArea(width, length)
       )

       rl.close();
    })
  })
}

function handleAnswer2() {
  console.clear();
  console.log("Calculate Triangle Area");

  // Ask for the width
  rl.question("Base: ", base => {
    
    // Ask for the length
    rl.question("Height: ", height => {
       console.log(
         "Here's the result:",
         calcTriangleArea(base, height)
       )

       rl.close();
    })
  })
}

// Ask the width
rl.question('Answer: ', answer => {
  if (answer == 1) {
    handleAnswer1()
  }

  else if (answer == 2) {
    handleAnswer2()
  }

  else {
    console.log("Sorry, there's no option for that!")
    rl.close()
  }
});
```
