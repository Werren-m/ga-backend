# Another Javascript Fundamental Topic
In the last week, you've learned about what is Javascript, and how to write a simple code in Javascript. And we will talk a little bit deeper about data in programming languange.

## Variable Scopes

### Global

When you declare a variable directly in the file, it means that you create a global variable.

```js
let a = 10; // This variable are global
```

### Local

But, if you create a variable inside a function, it means that your variable is a local variable

```js
function hello() {
  let message = "Hello World"; // Local Variable
  console.log(message);
}

hello()
// Hello World

console.log(message)
// ReferenceError: message is not defined
```

Meanwhile, if you create a global variable, it can be called inside any function

```js
let message = "Hello World";

function hello() {
  console.log(message);
}

hello();
// Hello World
```

### What if you have the same variable name on Global and Local Scopes

Okay, then, let's try it out!

```js
let a = 10;

function hello() {
  let a = 5;
  console.log(a);
}

hello();
// Output: 5
```

### We can even alter a global variable in via function

Keep in mind that this not a good practice, since function should not alter anything, it should return a new value.

```js
let a = 10;

function hello() {
  a = 5;
}

hello();
console.log(a);
// Output: 5
```

## Data Types
In the last week you've learn about String and Number. I'll talk a little bit about it in the lower level of it.

### Data in Memory

You've heard a little bit about String, Number and Boolean are a primitives data types, what does it mean?

So, when you create a variable lets say:

```js
let a = 10;
```

You computer will actually create a memory to store that data, which data? The number 10. In low level programming, number 10 is an Integer, what does it mean? It means that your memory have to prepare some space to store the integer.

```js
1010
```

10 in your memory will be looking like that. It contains 4 bits of memory. So, that means every data that you've created in your program is having a binary value. Each data will present different size in bits.

Well, it is too low if we want to discuss it more, because we're going to learn Backend Engineering, we don't need to worry about it.

### Primitives Data Type

So basically, primitive data types is a data that we can store it directly in the memory without referencing another memory address.

Here's the list of primitives datatype:
* Char (String)
* String (String)
* Text (String)
* Integer (Number)
* Float (Number)
* Double (Number)
* Boolean
  
#### Boolean

Boolean is a data that only consists two values, **true** or **false**. This data only takes 1 bits in the memory.

```js
const isTodayRaining = true;
```

#### String

String is a data types where we can store a character ("ABC^%^!@"). It was built by row of Char in the memory.

```js
const message = "Hello World";
```

See that data? It's a set of characters of "H", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ", etc.

#### Number

This data type, natively can do the mathematical operation like, addition, subtraction, exponential, division, etc.

```js
console.log(10 + 10); // Output: 10
```

# Higher Level Data Types

This is how I called it, btw. So, what is it? This kind of Data Types will save another kind of Primitive Data Types. Let's say you want to save a list of Fruits in a single variable. Then you can use this data types:
* Array
* Object
* Set

## Array
Array is a set of data that being saved in a single variable.

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pineapple", "Watermelon"]
```

We have a variable named fruits and it contains list of fruits inside it. Array map the data inside it with index. That means if you want to call an element inside that array, you have to call it with their index. Indexing in array starts from 0.

Let's say I want to call the first element of the array:

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pineapple", "Watermelon"]

console.log(fruits[0]);
// Apple

console.log(fruits[3]);
// Watermelon
```

Usually array is being used to store data that has the same identity. In our case string of fruits. Array can contains object as well.

## Object

It's the same with array, but instead of using number as their index, Object use something called key, and it will map the value of that key.

```js
let person = {
  name: "Fikri Rahmat Nurhidayat",
  address: "Solo",
  isMarried: false
}

console.log(person.name);
// Fikri Rahmat Nurhidayat

console.log(person["name"]);
// Fikri Rahmat Nurhidayat

if (!person.isMarried) {
  console.log(`${person.name} is single`);
} else {
  console.log(`${person.name} is taken`);
}
// Fikri Rahmat Nurhidayat is single
```

Object can contains array as well. Example:

```js
let person = {
  name: "Fikri",
  pets: [
    {
      name: "Jenny",
      type: "Cat"
    },
    {
      name: "Jessy",
      type: "Cat"
    }
  ],
  languange: [
    "Indonesian",
    "Javanese",
    "English"
  ]
}
```

# If Else Statement

I'm not going to discuss about this deep enough since we're going to have a discussion about Logic Flow later.

So, basically if else statement is just an idea of branching, which code do you want to execute.

![If Else](/.assets/B02-01-IfElse.png)

Example:

```js
const isTodayRaining = true;

if (isTodayRaining) {
  console.log("Use umbrella");
} else {
  console.log("NVM, I'll keep bringing umbrella in case if it's raining")
}
```

You can create if else statement inside a function since it is statement.

```js
function amIUnderage(age) {
  if (typeof age !== 'number') // To check if it's not a number
    throw new Error(`Expecting number, but got a ${typeof age}`);

  /*
    If the input was right, it will return the result of this operation
  */

  return age < 18; // Just basic operation
}

amIUnderage(18); // false
amIUnderage(12); // true
amIUnderage("Hello World");
// Error: Expecting number, but got a string
```

# Operators

Operator is a syntax that will allow the data interact with the others.

So in operation, there's three main things:
* Expression
* Operator
* Operand

## Expression and Operand

### Expression

Expression is a code that will define an operation.

```js
1 + 2; // This is an expression
```

Expression needs operand to run. So, what is operand?

### Operand

Operand is a code, or data that involved on an operation. Let's take a look on this code.

```js
/*
  1 and 2 is an operand of this operation
  1 + 2 is an expression that will shape the operation
  And + is the operator
*/
1 + 2;
```

## Binary and Unary Operation

There are two kind of Operation based on where it's operand:
* Unary
* Binary

### Binary

Binary is an operation that involving two or more operand.

```js
1 + 2 + 3; // Is a binary operation because it has 3 operand
```

### Unary

Unary is an operation that only involve one operand.
```js
let a = "10";
console.log(+a); // +a is an unary operation
```

# Boolean Expression

Boolean expression is an expression that shape an operation that will return Boolean value.

```js
/*
  1 == 2 is an Boolean Expression
*/
let a = 1 == 2; // false
```

## Equal Operators

In boolean expression we can use equal operators to perform an operation.

```js
let a = 1 == 2; // is Equal
let b = 1 != 2; // is not Equal
```

### Strict Equal

This operators will compare two operand without changing the real form of its data.

```js
let a = "1" === 1; // false
```

### Less Strict Equal

This operators will compare two operand, but before they actually compared, the operators will cast both operand into the same Data Types.

```js
/*
  "1" will be converted into 1
  1 remain the same

  or

  "1" will remain the same
  1 will be converted into "1"
*/
let a = "1" == 1; // true
```

## AND Operator

We can use and operator to create boolean expression. This operator will asume both of the data has `truthy` value, otherwise the result of that expression will be `falsy`.

```js
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

let c = 5;
let d = 5;

console.log(a == b && c == d); // false
console.log(a == 1 && c == d); // true
```

Or it can simply the if else statement. Conventionally:

```js
let c = 5;
let d = 5;

let result;

if (c == d) {
  result = "c is equal to d";
}

console.log(result) // c is equal to d
```

It can be simplified by using AND operator;

```js
let c = 5;
let d = 5;

let result = c == d && "c is equal to d";

console.log(result) // c is equal to d
```

Please, kindly do more practice on this kind of thing to know every behaviour that might occur on your operation.

## OR Operator

The OR operator is the opposite of the AND operators, if one the operand has a `truthy` value, then it will return that value.

```js
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

let c = 5;
let d = 5;

console.log(a == b && c == d); // true
```

It also can be used to simplify if else statement.

```js
let a = null;
let b = a || "A is falsy, so I took the place";

console.log(b) // A is empty, so I took the place
```

## Ternary Operators

Ternary operator is an expression that will return a value based on boolean expression in front of it:

```js
let a = 10;

let c = a == 10 ? "A is equal to 10" : "A is not equal to 10";

console.log(c); // A is equal to 10

let d = (a !== 10 || true) ? "A is not equal to 10, but okay" : "There's nothing right about it";
console.log(d); // A is not equal to 10, but okay

let e = a !== 10 ? "Hello" : "World";
console.log(e) // World
```


# Loops

Loops is a statement that will allow you to repeat some action! It is always been recommended to create a break statement (Tell the loop to stop)

## For Loop

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}
```

Those code will let you print out Hello World a hundred times.

When you write for loop, you will write the break statement as well. And which one is the break statement?

```js
i < 100;
```

Once the `i` reach the condition of being false, it will break.

```js
i = 0; // Which is still true in this condition i < 100;
i = 1; // Still true
...
...
i = 100; // It is no longer true, so the runner will break the loop
```

## While Loop

There's a difference between while loop and for loop. When you write a while loop. You don't do the incrementation directly once you've declared it. It is rarely used.

```js
let i = 0;

while (i < 100) {
  console.log("Hello World");
  i++;
}
```

Be careful, most people forgot to do the incrementation, or write the statement that will trigger the condition into false, and it will end up creating an infinite loop that will break your program.

## Loop Through Array

There's a shortcut by the way to loop an array, but I will tell you in the next section.

### With For Loop

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Manggo", "Melon"];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}
```

### With While Loop

```js
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Manggo", "Melon"];
let i = 0;

while (i < fruits.length) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
  i++;
}
```
