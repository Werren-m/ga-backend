# Overview

You already learned about Basic Syntax of Javascript and Data Types, let's talk about it a little bit deeper than before.

## Goals
* You know data types method that you can use.
* You know how to interact with Object and Array.
* You know about switch statement

# Data Structures in Javascript

In the previous section, you've already learned about what data types is, and there's two types of Data Types:

* Primitive Data Types
* Higher Level Data Types (Structured Data Types)

In this section, we will learn more about Object and Array is.

## DataTypes Methods

Did you know that DataType is came out with several method that we can use?

### String

String has a built in method that you can use accordingly.

```js
let message = "Hello World";

// String has a method that will allow you to split the string into an Array of char
console.log(message.split())
```

You can see more about what string can do in [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

#### Template Literal

Template literal is a string that initiated by backtick symbol. It will allow you to place a variable or even expression inside the string.

```js
let a = "Hello";

let literal = `${a} World`;
console.log(literal); // Hello World

// Or even an expresison

let random = `2 + 2 = ${2 + 2}`;
console.log(random) // 2 + 2 = 4
```

### Array

Array has a lot of method that will come in handy to be used in some situation.

```js
// We can check if the array has some element inside by using the .includes method

let fridge = [
  "Apple",
  "Wortel",
  "Milk",
  "Orange",
  "Leech",
  "Cabbage"
]

console.log(fridge.includes("Apple")) // true
console.log(fridge.includes("Egg")) // false
```

You can see more about array in [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

# Switch Case

You maybe can write very long if and else if statement, but it is not really practice to do that, there's another way to approach the same algorithm with switch case.

```js
let userChoice = 1;

switch (userChoice) {

  case 1:
    handleAnswer1();
    break;

  case 2:
    handleAnswer2();
    break;

  case 3:
    handleAnswer3();
    break;

  default:
    console.log("Sorry, option is not available")
}

```
