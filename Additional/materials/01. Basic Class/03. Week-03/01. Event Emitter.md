# Overview

In the last week, you've coded your apps to run synchronously. But, what if you want your code run on a certain event? Let's say when the registration happened, you want to tell the apps that there's a registration event, then your apps should run accordingly.

# Goals
* You know what Event is.
* You know what Event Emitter is.
* You know how to emit an event.
* You know how to handle if an event happened.

# Event

What is event in Programming? Event in a programming is a set of information about what currently happened.

![Button](/.assets/B03-01-Button.png)

See that button? That button will trigger some function when it is clicked. When the button clicked, some event happened, usually it is called as onClick event. But, it is completely Frontend example. But, how about backend?

Well, backend service itself is implementing events. You will build HTTP Server, which will listen to event called Request.

```bash
curl -X GET www.google.com
```

This code will do a HTTP Request on Google Server. Then the Request Event happened, and Google Server already registering function that will run when Request Event Happened.

To handle an event, we need to register something called **Event Listener**. Event listener is a function that will run on certain event, in that case, when request happened, then a function will run.

To hold an event, we need something called **Event Emitter**. Let's jump into it.

# Event Emitter Module

To do that thing, we need built-in `events` module in Node.js. Just like the other built-in module, we need to import it first.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events'); // Import
 // Initialize an instance because it is a class
const my = new EventEmitter();
```

What we did in above is importing the event module, initialize it.

## Event Listener

Now, we have the events module ready to run. So now, what we need to do is registering an event listener to our events instance (`my`).

```js
my.on("Some Event", function() {
  console.log("Some Event Happened")
})
```

In our code above, when `"Some Event"` happened, it will trigger a function that logging the `"Some Event Happened"`. Those code won't run until the event is happened or emitter. To emit an event we need to run the `.emit` method of our `my` instance.

## Event Emitter

Event emitter is a method that will allow you to hold an event in the apps. Just like the `onclick` event, emitted once the user click the button. 

```js
my.emit("Some Event");
// Output: Some Event Happened
```

> Note: You can only emit an event an expect it to run the listener if only you've registered listener before.

## Listener First then Emitter

If you haven't registered listener when you emit an event, your event won't trigger anything.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events'); // Import
 // Initialize an instance because it is a class
const my = new EventEmitter();

// Emit the event
my.emit("Some Event");

// Registering a listener
my.on("Some Event", function() {
  console.log("Some Event Happened")
})
```

When you run that code, it won't log anything to the console.

# Passing Data Through Event

When some event happened, we can pass the data that the listener might need, let's say we want to pass the user's email when the user's failed to login.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events'); // Import
const readline = require('readline');

 // Initialize an instance because it is a class
const my = new EventEmitter();
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
})

// Registering a listener
my.on("Login Failed", function(email) {
  // TODO: Saving the login trial count in the database
  console.log(email, "is failed to login!");
})

const user = {
  login(email, password) {
    const passwordStoredInDatabase = "123456";

    if (password !== passwordStoredInDatabase) {
      my.emit("Login Failed", email); // Pass the email to the listener
    } else {
      // Do something
    }
  }
}

rl.question("Email: ", function(email) {
  rl.question("Password: ", function(password) {
    user.login(email, password) // Run login function
  })
})
```
