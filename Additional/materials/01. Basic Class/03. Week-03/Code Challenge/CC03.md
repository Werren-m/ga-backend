# Code Challenge Week 04

These week's code challenge is all about WebAPI, since you might get confused by OOP. But it is okay if you want to implement this code using OOP, and also it is not forbidden if you didn't.

## Requirements

Create these endpoint:
* `/products` => this endpoint will show all of the products that has been listed inside `products.json`. The response should be served as JSON.
* `/products/available` => Only show the products which has stocks more than 0. The response should be served as JSON.
* `/users` => Serve `users.json` as response, but please hide the password by not showing it on response!

## How to work on this challenge?

Download this folder, then working on it, upload it to your Repository as usual, and name it inside the `Basic Class` folder
