![BinarXGlints](https://ik.imagekit.io/latihan/Glints___EX_3kWO.png)

Hello guys, this is a repository for materials that you will learn in the class.
Please read this material before the class. Because what we will do is flipped learning.
That means you have to read this before you attend the class.
Don't worry, if you still don't understand any materials in this repository,
You can ask me directly in my Telegram or Platform Group.
